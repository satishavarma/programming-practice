          A monsoon is traditionally defined as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation. However, the term is now used more broadly to describe seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation associated with the asymmetric heating of land and sea. This broader definition includes the seasonal shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the significant temperature and humidity differences between land and sea, which drive the monsoon cycles.
