      <!-- When it has three values, the first value is applied to the top border, the second value is applied to the right and left borders, and the third value is applied to the bottom border:-->
       
      <!-- When it has four values, the values are applied to top, right, bottom and left - in that order.-->

     <!-- The border-width property is used to specify the thickness of the borders.
      For specifying values, we can use the standard absolute or relative units or we can use values like thin, medium or thick. -->

      <!-- BORDER STYLE-->

      <!-- We can set different styles, widths and colours for the borders of the different sides of an element. We do this by specifying multiple values for the same property, like border-width: 3px 3px 4px 5px.
      However, there are individual properties such as border-top-style, border-right-width, border-bottom-color among others, for styling borders for the specific sides:-->

      <br>
      <br>
      <div id="firstBorderside">
        Left and right color properties
      </div>
      <div id="secondBorderside">
        Top and bottom style properties
      </div>

      <br>
      <br>
      <!-- BOrder Shorthand Property-->
       <!-- For the border shorthand property, border-style value is required. The colour and width are optional.-->

       <!-- When you need rounded corners instead of the default sharp corners, you can use the border-radius property.-->

       <div id="firstRadius">
      </div>
      <div id="secondRadius">
      </div>

      <br>
      <br>

      The first value is for the top-left and right-bottom.
       The second value is for top-right and left-bottom -->

       The first value is for the top-left corner.
       The second value is for top-right and left-bottom.
      The third value is for the bottom-right corner.-->
