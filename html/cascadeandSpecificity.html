       <!-- When the selectors are identical, or have the same importance, the rule that comes later wins. But what happens with different selectors like in the example given below -->


       <!-- Though the rule color: red appears later in the code, the rule color: purple is used.

        This is because, an ID selector is more specific than a class selector. The rule from a more specific selector is used. Here #p1 is said to have a higher Specificity.-->
