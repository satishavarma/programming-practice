         <!-- We can select an element directly using its class, or id, or the tag name. But sometimes, we need to select elements based on their relationship with other elements. For example, how will we select all paragraphs that are nested inside a div?-->   

         <div>
            <p>
              This Paragraph will be blue because it is within a div
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            This Paragraph will be black because the style changes don't apply to it.
          </p>

          <!-- NOTE = Here, > is a combinator. Notice that the styles were only applied to the p elements within a div-->

          <!-- Selecting all Child Elements-->
           <!-- When we need to select a particular set of child elements, we use the space character like this-->

              The internet is built with links
              <a href="#">Link 1 inside div 1</a>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <a href="#">Link 2 inside div 2</a>
          </div>
          <a href="#">Link 3</a>
          <div>
            <p>
              A broken link is a broken promise.
              <a href="#">Link 4 inside div 3</a>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <a href="#">Link 5 inside div 4</a>
          </div>
          <a href="#">Link 6</a>

          <!-- Here, div a will select all a elements that are the children of a div element, even when those a elements are nested deeper within the div-->
