         <!-- We can select an element directly using its class, or id, or the tag name. But sometimes, we need to select elements based on their relationship with other elements. For example, how will we select all paragraphs that are nested inside a div?-->   

         <div>
            <p>
              This Paragraph will be blue because it is within a div

          <p>
            This Paragraph will be black because the style changes don't apply to it.

            <!-- Selecting Immediate Next Element-->

            <!-- When we need to select the immediate next element, we use the + character like this:

            h1 + p
            h1 + p will select a p element that immediately follows an h1 element. The two elements should be on the same nesting level. This means that they should both be the direct child of the same parent.-->

             Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas. Stands of lotus drop hundreds of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond.

         <!-- When we need to select any sibling element that follow a particular element, we use the ~ character to combine two selectors like this:

         h1 ~ p
         h1 ~ p will select all the p elements that come after an h1 element within the same parent element. This will select all descendant p elements too. The p element should be after the h1 element and should be a direct child or a descendant of the parent of the h1 element-->

            While some sprout immediately, and most are eaten by wildlife, the remaining seeds can remain dormant for an extensive period of time as the pond silts in and dries out.
