         <!-- GRID-->
          
         <!-- CSS Grid allows us to control the layout of a page by dividing it into rows and columns. This makes designing complex and large responsive layouts, simple and easy.-->


         <!-- In the below example we applied display: grid property to the container, and used grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define the number and size of the items in the rows and columns.-->

         <div class="container">
            <div>1</div>
            <div>2</div>
            <div>3</div>
            <div>4</div>
            <div>5</div>
            <div>6</div>
          </div>

          <!-- 2 = GRID CONTAINER-->

           <!-- A grid container is created by setting display property to grid, a grid container consists of rows and columns. There are some common terms that are good to know while working with grid, like Grid Cell, Grid Lines and Grid Tracks.-->
