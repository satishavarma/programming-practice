         <!-- GRID-->
          
         <!-- CSS Grid allows us to control the layout of a page by dividing it into rows and columns. This makes designing complex and large responsive layouts, simple and easy.-->


         <!-- In the below example we applied display: grid property to the container, and used grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define the number and size of the items in the rows and columns.-->

         <div class="container">
            <div>1</div>
            <div>2</div>
            <div>3</div>
            <div>4</div>
            <div>5</div>
            <div>6</div>
          </div>

          <!-- 2 = GRID CONTAINER-->

           <!-- A grid container is created by setting display property to grid, a grid container consists of rows and columns. There are some common terms that are good to know while working with grid, like Grid Cell, Grid Lines and Grid Tracks.-->



         <!-- 3 = Grid Lines -->

         <!-- Grid lines can be seen on either side of a row or column and can be either vertical called "column grid lines" or horizontal called "row grid lines"..-->

         <!-- Grid Tracks-->
          <!-- Grid track is the space between two adjacent grid lines, i.e. grid's columns or rows. The grid track between the first and second rows of grid lines is seen here.-->

          <!-- Grid Cell-->
           <!-- Grid cell is similar to cells in a spreadsheet, it is the smallest unit of space you can have on your CSS grid layout.-->
