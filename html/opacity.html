      <!-- The opacity property is used to define transparency for elements.

      You can specify any value between 0.0 and 1.0.

      Here, 0 is fully transparent, 0.5 is semi-transparent and 1 is fully opaque.-->

              Autumn, also known as fall, is one of the four temperate seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably.

          <!-- Opacity of the div is set to 0.5, but the child elements h1 and p also become semi-transparent. This makes it hard to read the text.

          If we want the opacity to apply only to the background, we can specify the background color value using rgba instead of using rgb.

         rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)-->
