     <!-- When you want to apply styles to an element in a specific state, such as, when the element is hovered over by the mouse pointer or when the element is focused on by user's click or tap, you can use pseudo-classes like :hover or :focus-->

     <!-- NOTE = Pseudo-classes act similar to classes, but without actually adding class names to your HTML. This is why, they are called pseudo-classes.-->
