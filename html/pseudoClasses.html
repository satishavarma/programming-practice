     <!-- When you want to apply styles to an element in a specific state, such as, when the element is hovered over by the mouse pointer or when the element is focused on by user's click or tap, you can use pseudo-classes like :hover or :focus-->

     <!-- NOTE = Pseudo-classes act similar to classes, but without actually adding class names to your HTML. This is why, they are called pseudo-classes.-->

     <form>
        <input type="text" id="name" placeholder="First name">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Last name">
        <button type="button">Submit</button>

      <!-- HOVER-->
       <!-- When a user takes the mouse pointer over an element, you can style it differently by appending :hover to the selector-->

      <!-- Focus-->
       <!--  When you click or tap on an element, or when you use the tab key on keyboard to move to it, an element gets focus. By default, the browser adds a blue outline to an element that is focused. This can be changed using the :focus pseudo-class-->
