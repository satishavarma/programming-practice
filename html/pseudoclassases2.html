      <!-- Styling Links with Pseudo-classes-->

      <!-- Along with :hover, we can change the appearance of links depending on other user actions. We can change the link styling for when the user clicks the link or based on whether the link was previously visited or not:

      :visited - Used if the link was previously visited. Since we show our previews inside an iframe, the visited styles will not apply. So we have added a link with href="" to emulate the visited behavior.

      :active - Applied when the link is just clicked-->

      <p>
        First, take the cursor on the link to see the hover styles take effect.
        Next click on it to see the active styles take effect.
        Notice that the visited styles take effect after you have clicked it once.
      </p>
      <a href="#1">
        Hover and click
      </a>

      <!-- First and Last Child-->
       <!-- We can also apply styles to an element based on its location in HTML. If it's the first child or the last child of its parent element, we can use :first-child or :last-child pseudo-classes-->
