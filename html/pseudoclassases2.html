      <!-- Styling Links with Pseudo-classes-->

      <!-- Along with :hover, we can change the appearance of links depending on other user actions. We can change the link styling for when the user clicks the link or based on whether the link was previously visited or not:

      :visited - Used if the link was previously visited. Since we show our previews inside an iframe, the visited styles will not apply. So we have added a link with href="" to emulate the visited behavior.

      :active - Applied when the link is just clicked-->

      <p>
        First, take the cursor on the link to see the hover styles take effect.
        Next click on it to see the active styles take effect.
        Notice that the visited styles take effect after you have clicked it once.
      </p>
      <a href="#1">
        Hover and click
      </a>
      <br/>
      <a href="">
        Visited
      </a>


      <!--  Active State vs Focus State-->
      <form>
        <input type="text" id="name" placeholder="First name">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Last name">
        <button type="button">Submit</button>
      </form>

      <!-- First and Last Child-->
       <!-- We can also apply styles to an element based on its location in HTML. If it's the first child or the last child of its parent element, we can use :first-child or :last-child pseudo-classes-->

       <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Services</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <a href="#">Link 1</a>
        <a href="#">Link 2</a>
        <a href="#">Link 3</a>
      </div>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <!-- nth Child-->
       <!-- Apart from the first and last child, you can also select a specific child element using the :nth-child pseudo-class-->

       <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Services</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Here :nth-child(2) selects the 2nd child. Try changing the number to 1, 3 or 4 to see a different child being selected.

      The child count starts from 1. Hence :nth-child(1) is same as :first-child.

      Using the nth-child pseudo-class, you can also select even or odd numbered child elements, as shown below. Try changing odd to even in the following example-->


      <h2>Planets of the Solar System</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mercury</li>
  <li>Venus</li>
  <li>Earth</li>
  <li>Mars</li>
  <li>Jupiter</li>
  <li>Saturn</li>
  <li>Uranus</li>
  <li>Neptune</li>
</ul>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<!-- :nth-child(n+3) - Selects all matching child elements starting from 3rd one :nth-child(3n) - Selects every 3rd matching child element :nth-child(3n-2) - Selects every 3rd matching child element starting from the first one-->


<div>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>

  <span></span>
  <span></span>
</div>


     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <!-- First and Last of Type
With the :first-child pseudo-class, you can select a particular type of element if its the first child of its parent. For example, span:first-child selects a span element, only if its the first child of its parent. So, in the following example, nothing is selected-->
     <div>
      <p>This is a beginning paragraph</p>
      <span>Span 1</span>
      <span>Span 2</span>
      <span>Span 3</span>
      <p>This is an ending paragraph</p>
    </div>


    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <!-- nth of Type-->

    <!-- When you want to select the 7th element of its type within its parent, or select the first 15 elements or every 3rd element and so on, you can use the :nth-of-type pseudo-class-->

    <div>
