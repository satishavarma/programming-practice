    <!-- Pseudo-elements-->
          <!-- When you want to apply styles to a part of an element like the first letter or first line of a paragraph, or add some content before or after an element using CSS, without actually adding a new element in HTML, you can use pseudo-elements like ::first-line, ::first-letter, ::before and ::after.-->

         <!-- NOTE == Note that while pseudo-classes start with a single colon :, pseudo-elements start with a double colon ::-->

          <!-- Also, if you wish to select the first letter of only the first paragraph, you can combine the :first-child pseudo-class with :first-letter like this:

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

          The second value defined is 2. As we can see the letter is dropped 2 lines below the current line of text.-->
