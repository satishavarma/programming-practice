    <!-- Pseudo-elements-->
          <!-- When you want to apply styles to a part of an element like the first letter or first line of a paragraph, or add some content before or after an element using CSS, without actually adding a new element in HTML, you can use pseudo-elements like ::first-line, ::first-letter, ::before and ::after.-->

         <!-- NOTE == Note that while pseudo-classes start with a single colon :, pseudo-elements start with a double colon ::-->

          <!-- Also, if you wish to select the first letter of only the first paragraph, you can combine the :first-child pseudo-class with :first-letter like this:

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

          <!-- In the above code, we have defined the first letter L to have a size of 3. This makes the letter occupy 3 lines.

          The second value defined is 2. As we can see the letter is dropped 2 lines below the current line of text.-->

          <!-- Difference Between Pseudo-class & Pseudo-element-->

          <!-- Pseudo-classes select elements based on their state.

           Pseudo-elements select specific parts of an element or insert additional content.-->
