      <!-- Media Queries-->
       <!-- With CSS flexbox, we can create blocks which automatically adjust their sizes for small and large screens. However, most of the times, this isn't sufficient to create a responsive layout.-->

          <h2>Solar System</h2>
          <p>
            The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.

          <h2>The Sun</h2>
          <p>
            The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core.

          <h2>Earth</h2>
          <p>
            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands.

      <!-- The Media Rule -->

      <!-- This rule contains a media type screen and a media feature max-width: 630px.

       Other media type values such as all, print and speech can also be used. A media feature expression tests for a condition. The styles within the media query are applied if this condition is true.

       In our previous example, for a max-width of 630px screen, the flex direction column is applied. For screen sizes greater than 630px, the condition is false. Hence the styles are not applied.-->

       <!-- We can also combine two or more media features using and, or, not keywords-->
