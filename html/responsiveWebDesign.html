      <!-- Media Queries-->
       <!-- With CSS flexbox, we can create blocks which automatically adjust their sizes for small and large screens. However, most of the times, this isn't sufficient to create a responsive layout.-->

        <div class="col">
          <h2>Solar System</h2>
          <p>
            The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.

        <div class="col">
          <h2>The Sun</h2>
          <p>
            The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core.

        <div class="col">
          <h2>Earth</h2>
          <p>
            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands.

      <!-- The Media Rule -->

      <!-- This rule contains a media type screen and a media feature max-width: 630px.

       Other media type values such as all, print and speech can also be used. A media feature expression tests for a condition. The styles within the media query are applied if this condition is true.

       In our previous example, for a max-width of 630px screen, the flex direction column is applied. For screen sizes greater than 630px, the condition is false. Hence the styles are not applied.-->

       <!-- We can also combine two or more media features using and, or, not keywords-->

      <!-- Media Queries for Orientation-->
       <!-- We can also change some styles based on whether our web page is being viewed in portrait or landscape orientation:-->

       <!-- Portrait orientation is when the screen width is smaller than the height and landscape is when screen width is larger than the height.-->

       <p>
        The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.

      <!-- Responsive Images-->
       <!-- When we specify the width of an image in pixels or em, on larger screens there might be a lot of empty space next to image and on smaller screens, a horizontal scrollbar might appear.

       The best approach to making the images responsive, without the need for media queries, is to set their max-width as 100%. This makes the image occupy full width of the screen as long as the screen width is smaller than the original image width.-->

       <!-- Responsive Text-->
        <!-- Just like any other style, we can change the text size too, based on screen width using media queries-->

         <h1>Large heading on desktop</h1>
          <h2>Relatively smaller one</h2>
