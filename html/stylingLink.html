    <!-- STYLING LINKS-->
      <!-- Links can be styled in many different ways using properties like color, background-color, border, padding, text-decoration and so on:-->

      <h2>Styling Links</h2>
    <a href="#" id="first">
     Colored link
        </a>
     <a href="#" id="second">
       No underline
     </a>
     <a href="#" id="third">
       With background
      </a>
        <a href="#" id="fourth">
      With border
       </a>

       <br>
       <br>
        <br>



       <!-- Spacing Around links-->
       <h2>Explore Topics:</h2>
       <div>
         <a href="#">Design</a>
         <a href="#">Science</a>
         <a href="#">Music</a>
       </div>
       <p>Expand your knowledge in various domains!</p>

       <!-- In the above example, we are attempting to add space above and below the <a> tags, using the margin-top and margin-bottom properties. But, it will have no effect. Try changing the value of margin-top or margin-bottom to 100px. You'll see that no space is added above or below the links.

       This is because, by default, <a> tags have an inline display property.-->

        <!-- We can change the appearance of links not only like the normal elements, but also depending on some user actions. Like when the user takes their cursor over the link, or just when the user clicks the link or based on whether the link was previously visited or not. For this, we use the following link states:

         a:visited - Applies if the link was visited previously

         a:hover - Applies when the user takes the cursor over the link

         a:active - Applies when the link is just clicked
         
         Here, a:visited, a:hover and a:active are called Pseudo-class selectors.

         a:active must be specified after a:hover and a:hover must be specified after a:visited for the styles to take effect.

         -->


         <p>
            First, take the cursor on the link to see the hover styles take effect.
            Next click on it to see the active styles take effect.
            Notice that the visited styles take effect after you have clicked it once.
