// POINT 1 = Naming Variables

// When we declare a new variable, there are certain rules we need to follow for the name of the variable:

// The name should either start with an alphabet or an underscore


const validVariableName = 120;
console.log(validVariableName);


// POINT 2 =  A reserved keyword cannot be used as a variable name. For example, let is a keyword used to declare variables.We cannot declare a variable with the name l

// const let = 170;  This will show an error console.log(let);


// POINT 3 Naming Variables - camelCase
// To distinguish each word, we capitalize the first alphabet of all the words, except for the first word. This is known as camelCase.

const lengthOfBox = 120;
console.log(lengthOfBox);
